                Space launch is the earliest part of a flight that reaches
                space. Space launch involves liftoff, when a rocket or other
                space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating ship or midair
                aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types:
                rocket launch, and non-rocket spacelaunch.

                A spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer
                space. A type of artificial satellite, spacecraft are used for a
                variety of purposes, including communications, Earth
                observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization,
                planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.

                Space shuttle, also called Space Transportation System,
                partially reusable rocket-launched vehicle designed to go into
                orbit around Earth, to transport people and cargo to and from
                orbiting spacecraft, and to glide to a runway landing on its
                return to Earthâ€™s surface that was developed by the U.S.
